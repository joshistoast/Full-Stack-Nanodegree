# Logs Analysis
By **Josh Corbett**

**Logs Analysis** is a python and sql project for displaying information on a database

## About this Project
**Logs Analysis** is a project aimed at extracting certain information from a 'news' database.

## Prerequisites

To run the program you must have:

* A computer (Windows/MacOS/Linux)
* Python 2 or 3 installed
* A Virtual Machine and Vagrant installed
* The `FSND-Virtual-Machine` zipfile with the database
* Working knowledge of the command line and/or terminal

## How to Run

1. Clone the Repository onto your local machine.
2. Open the project files and transfer the `newsdata.sql` file into the project.
3. Open the project in your terminal or command line interface.
4. run `news.py`.

## How it Works

* The file `news.py` is a python script that connects to an sql database called `news`.
* The python script `news.py`, once run will execute sql queries to find information located in the `news` database or `newsdata.sql`.
* Once the information is found, it is formatted and printed in the terminal session.
