# Fresh Tomatoes Movie Trailers
By **Josh Corbett**

Fresh Tomatoes is a python script that displays a set of movies and trailers as an `html` website

## About this project
**Fresh Tomatoes** is a movie trailers website consisting mostly of python, which later generates a web page.

## Prerequisites

To run the program you must have...

* Computer (Windows/MacOS),
* Python 2 installed (yes, this is an older python release),
* Working knowledge of command line and/or terminal

## How to Run

1. Clone the Repository onto your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. run `entertainment_center.py` and a web page will open.

## How it Works

* The file `entertainment_center.py` holds a set of data made possible by using the class `Movie()` initialized in `media.py`. 
* `entertainment_center.py`, once run, will pass the contained data to `fresh_tomatoes.py` and will proceed to generate an html webpage called `fresh_tomatoes.html`.
* This webpage will automatically open and preview the associated movies, titles, descriptions, and trailers established in `entertainment_center.py`.
